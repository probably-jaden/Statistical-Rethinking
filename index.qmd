[Statistical Rethinking](https://oceanrep.geomar.de/id/eprint/55819/1/Statistical%20Rethinking%202nd%20Edition.pdf) has been a fun unlearning of the frequentist techniques that I practised in my undergrad. I appreciated it so much that I wanted to document my current statistical skillset using his textbook as the structure and basebone. Richard McElreath also has a great series on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdnMWdICdRs&list=PLDcUM9US4XdPz-KxHM4XHt7uUVGWWVSus) going through each chapter of his book that I highly reccommend as well.
